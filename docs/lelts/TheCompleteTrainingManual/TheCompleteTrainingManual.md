**Pronunciation Workshop Manual -** *Introduction*

> **I n T r o d u C T I o n**

**Welcome!**

> Congratulations! You are about to embark on a very exciting program.
> Learning to speak English clearly, with proper pronunciation is the
> single most important skill you must have to communicate effectively
> in today's world market. The *Pronunciation Workshop Video Training
> Program* will enhance your English speaking abilities and vocal
> skills, improve your self-confidence and will greatly increase your
> chances for success.
>
> This course is based on years of linguistic research and has produced
> dramatic results for thousands of individuals around the globe. It is
> designed to help you sound "*more American*" for oral presentations,
> interviews, teaching, business situations, telephone conversations and
> general daily communication.
>
> When a person learns English as a Second Language, they are speaking
> English *"filtered"* through their first language. They are using
> their native language's "speech rules" of pronunciation (and often
> grammar) on their new language...They are not aware of the American
> set of "speech rules". This is basically what the Pronunciation
> Workshop program teaches you... *"The Speech Rules of American
> English".*
>
> There are many schools and classes which teach English all around the
> world; however, very few of them address the "speech rules" that you
> will learn in this course. This is because many of the teachers who
> are providing English training, do not know of these "speech rules".
> Many of them are even making errors themselves and teaching them to
> you! We hear this daily from our clients.
>
> When you were a child and learned your first language, you constructed
> a mental inventory of your native language's speech sounds. Those
> sounds became a part of your speech repertoire. Unfortunately, you are
> now inserting these speech sounds into your English. Today, when you
> speak English, you reach into that inventory and come out with many
> substitute sounds, something that is close, but nonetheless incorrect.
> These repeated errors in conversation often cause you to be
> misunderstood.
>
> Some people call what we do "Foreign Accent Reduction"...this is not
> quite accurate, for you are not reducing your foreign accent\...you
> are actually gaining an American Accent - - you are adding new sounds
> and new "speech rules" to your speech inventory.
>
> While you progress through this program, you will be learning things
> you were never aware of before. You most likely will find yourself
> saying, *"Wow! I never*

**Pronunciation Workshop Manual -** *Introduction*

> *knew that!"* Changing your old speech habits takes time. At first you
> may possibly be apprehensive using the learned techniques. However,
> eventually you will relax and the words and sounds will flow smoothly
> and clearly on their own.
>
> Once you complete each session, it should *not* be your objective to
> start speaking differently right away. Your focus should be on
> listening to the sounds of your speech and the speech of those around
> you. For example, when you say *"[T]{.underline}ank you"* instead of
> *"[T]{.underline}hank you",* your focus should not be on saying it
> correctly[...]{.underline}but rather, "Oops -- [I ju]{.underline}st
> said that word wrong...I should have used a *TH* sound". It is this
> AWARENESS that will eventually lead you to the improved pronunciation
> skills you are striving for.
>
> Each video training session has its own accompanying chapter in this
> manual with practice material. You will notice during the video
> classes that I often speak slowly and exaggerate certain target
> sounds. I do this purposely so that you can 'hear' and understand what
> I am teaching you. I recommend that you try practicing the material a
> little everyday using the learned techniques. Practice speaking VERY
> SLOWLY, out loud, in a strong voice and exaggerate the mouth
> movements. You will be retraining the muscles of your mouth and tongue
> to move in new and different ways while mastering your new
> pronunciation patterns. Theoretically, once you understand the
> concepts and have retrained yourself, eventually these new speech
> patterns will progress into your own spontaneous conversational rapid
> speech.
>
> To receive maximum benefits, we recommend that you take our course
> over a period of two to three months, focusing on one session per
> week. Try to practice daily with the videos.
>
> The program you are about to begin was created to help people "sound
> American" for the purposes of teaching, interviewing, lecturing,
> business and general daily communication. Although America has many
> regional pronunciation differences, the accent you will learn is that
> of standard American English as spoken and understood by the majority
> of educated native speakers.
>
> Changing your old speech habits takes time. At first, the information
> presented on the videos may seem unusual, but eventually, you will see
> that these techniques will transform your speech, providing you with
> clearer, more intelligible English speaking abilities.
>
> Good Luck and have fun! I hope you enjoy this program as much as I
> enjoy teaching it!

• Your tongue moves back in your mouth, NOT forward.

word.

height="11.0in"}

**Pronunciation Workshop Manual -** *Session 2*

*Examples:*

> 1 cup, 2 cups

(the 'p' in *cup* is unvoiced, so you just add an unvoiced 's')

> 1 cat, 2 cats

(the 't' in *cat* is unvoiced, so just add an unvoiced 's')

> I break, he breaks
>
> I stop, he stops

Rule #2

If a word ends in any of these sounds: 's,z,sh,ch,or dg (j)'

when adding an 'S' ending, add... *[IZZZZZZ]{.underline}*

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| > *Examples:*\                    | > 2 Pages\                        |
| > 1 Page\                         | > 2 Buses\                        |
| > 1 Bus\                          | > 2 Lunches\                      |
| > 1 Lunch\                        | > He Raises\                      |
| > I Raise,\                       | > He Brushes\                     |
| > I Brush,\                       | > He Pushes                       |
| > I Push,                         |                                   |
+===================================+===================================+
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Rule #3

If a word [ends]{.underline} in a vowel sound (like the word *Tree*) or
a voiced consonant (like

the word *Game*), then when you add an 'S', continue the voicing
throughout

the entire word, and it should become a voiced ZZZZ.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| > *Examples:*\        | > 2 Treezzzz          | 9                     |
| > 1 Tree,             | > (correctly spelled  |                       |
|                       | >                     |                       |

How many stars can you see on a dark, clear night? You can see about
3,000

stars with your eyes alone. But keep in mind that you are viewing only
part

of the sky. If the whole sky were visible, you could count about 5,000
stars. If

you look through a small telescope you might see as many as 600,000
stars.

Through the most powerful telescopes, astronomers can spot millions of
stars.

No one is sure exactly how many stars there are altogether, but
astronomers

believe there are at least 200 billion, billion stars out in space.

*Putting it all together -- Part II*

[A foreign student]{.underline}

> When a student from another country comes to study in the United
> States, he has to find out for himself the answers to many questions,
> and he has many problems to think about. Where should he live? Would
> it be better living in a dormitory or in a private room off campus?
> Should he spend all of his time studying, or should he take advantage
> of the many cultural and social activities that are offered? At first,
> he may not feel that he fits in with the American culture. He may not

[The Chinese Language]{.underline}

> Chinese is a most unusual language. It differs from English and most
> other major languages in that it has hundreds of different dialects. A
> person who lives in one section of the vast country of China, often
> cannot understand a fellow Chinese who lives in another section. These
> two major dialects are Cantonese and Mandarin. Cantonese is a southern
> dialect. Mandarin, a dialect that originated in northern China, is
> spoken by more Chinese than any other dialect.
>
> Non-Chinese people often say that the Chinese seem to "*sing*" their
> language. Chinese sounds as though it is sung, because many words are
> only one-syllable long and because the tone of voice changes for each
> word. As in English, many words have more than one meaning. The
> speaker's tone of voice indicates each word's specific meaning.
>
> Even more fascinating than the variety of spoken sounds is the Chinese
> written language. It has no alphabet. Instead, it employs signs called
> "characters." Each spoken word in the language is represented by a
> separate character. Originally, the characters were drawings that
> depicted the meanings of words, but over the years, they have
> simplified, and most no longer look like the things they represent.

> imagination carefully put the pieces together to form the
> supercontinent. You will see that if you took away the South Atlantic
> Ocean and pressed South America and Africa together they would fit
> very nicely. You could continue removing oceans and seas and put other
> parts of the world together quite easily until you get to those last
> two pieces of Australia and Antarctica. Scientists believe that the
> continents of Australia and Antarctica were once linked together. They
> may have split slowly off from the supercontinent and then separated
> from each other as recently as 40 million years ago.
