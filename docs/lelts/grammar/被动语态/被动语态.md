## 1. 被动语态的各种时态

> **被动语态（The Passive Voice）是动词的一种形式，表示主语是谓语动词的承受者。被动语态便于论述客观事实，故常用于科技文章、新闻报道、书刊介绍以及景物描写。被动语态没有将来进行时、过去将来进行时和完成进行时形式。**

##### (1) 一般现在时的被动语态

## 5. “主+动+宾+宾补”句型变为被动结构

> **这种句型有两个宾语，一般地说一为间接宾语，一为直接宾语。变为被动结构时，只将主动结构中的一个宾语变为被动结构中的主语，另一宾语不变。**

→It is said that he is the richest man in the city. 

据说他是全市头号富翁。

→He is said to be the richest man in the city. 

据说他是全市头号富翁。

> **当说话人认为主动句的主语无关紧要，或者不清楚谁是谓语动作的发出者时，便常常使用上述形式的被动句。如：**

It was reported that the boy had been found. 

据报道，男孩已被找到。

The boy was reported to have been found. 

据报道，男孩已被找到。

> **常用于上述被动句型的动词有：acknowledge, assume, believe, claim, consider, declare, estimate, expect, find, know, presume, report, say, think等。** 



## 7. 含有被动意义的主动语态

> **英语中有一些表示被动意义的主动句，其谓语所表示的不是主语的动作，而是其内在的性能。这种句子的特点是：主语为无生命名词，谓语动词为一般现在时；肯定句必须带方式状语；否定句的谓语可以带情态动词。如：**

She is to blame. 她应该受到责备。

The house is to rent. 这个房子要出租。
