## 2. 与现在事实相反的非真实条件句

> **虚拟语气用在与现在事实相反条件句中时，条件从句的谓语用动词的过去式 （be的过去式用were），结果主句的谓语用should(第一人称)或would(第二、三人称)＋动词原形。如：**

## 4. 与将来事实相反的非真实条件句

##### （1）虚拟语气用在与将来事实相反的条件句中时，条件从句的谓语用动词的过去式（be的过去式用were），were to或should，结果主句用should(第一人称)或 would（第二、三人称）＋ 动词原形。如：

If it rained( were to rain/ should rain) tomorrow, I should stay at home. 

如果明天下雨，我会呆在家里。

If the teacher knew it, he would be angry.

万一老师知道了这事，他会生气的。

If something should go wrong, the control rods would drop.

万一发生什么事故，控制杆就会下落。



##### (2) 在与将来事实相反的条件句中，其条件从句的谓语也可用were to ＋ 动词原形。这种虚拟式比较正式，多用于书面语中，其假想性很强，实现性很小。如：

If I were to do it, I would do it another way.

要是我来做这件事，我会用另一种方法。

If he were to come tomorrow, I would speak to him about it.

假如明天他来，我会跟他谈这个问题。



## 5. 情态助动词用于虚拟语气

> **有不少情态助动词也可用于虚拟语气。如：**

May you live a long and happy life.

愿你长寿幸福。（may 只用于表示愿望）

没有摩擦力，汽车就不能开动。

But for your help, we couldn't have succeeded.

要不是你的帮助，我们是不会成功的。

如果没有发明计算机的话，宇宙飞行的许多问题就不可能解决。



## 6. were， had， should等置于主语之前

> **在书面语中，条件从句可以不用连词 if，而将谓语中的过去式 were，had 或 should 等移至主语之前。如：**

Were you in my position, what would you do?

假如你处在我的位置，你会怎么做？

Were he to leave today, he would get there by Friday.

如果他今天动身，星期五前会赶到那儿。

Had some work been done, energy would have been applied.

如果做了一定量的功，就一定消耗了能量。

万一明天下雨，会议就会延期。

Should he come, he would be able to examine the trial run of the machine. 

如果他来，他就能检验这台机器的试车情况了。 



## 7. 条件从句与结果主句所表示的时间不一致

##### (1) 当条件从句与结果主句所表示的时间不一致（如一个是过去发生的，一个是现在发生的）时，虚拟语气的形式应作相应的调整。如：

If you were in better health, we would have asked you to come. 

如果你身体好一些，我们早就请你来了。

If we had consulted him on the question yesterday, we should know what to do now.

假如昨天我们向他请教了这个问题，现在就知道该怎么办了。

You would be much better now if you had taken my advice. 

假如你接受了我的意见，你现在就会好得多。



##### (2) 如果条件从句用 if I were ...，结果主句则可用任何时间的虚拟形式。如：

If I were not busy, I would have come.

假如我不忙，我就会去的。（were表过去）



## 8. 虚拟语气在含蓄条件句中的用法

##### (1) 条件暗含在短语中。如：

我们不知道他的电话号码，否则我们就会给他打电话。（暗含条件是otherwise）

Without your help, we wouldn't have achieved so much. 

没有你的帮助，我们不可能取得这么大的成绩。

（暗含条件是介词短语without your help）

不立即润滑轴承就会引起很大的故障。

（暗含条件是not to lubricate the bearing immediately）

Alone, she would have been terrified. 

假如孤身一人，她会很害怕的。

##### (2) 条件暗含在上下文中。如：

I would not have done it that way.

我是不会那么做的。（可能暗含if I were you）

I was busy that day. Otherwise I would have come to help you.

我那天很忙。否则我会来帮你的。（可能暗含if I hadn't been so busy.）

我是会买下那台影碟机的。（可能暗含if I had the money）

要不是碰到暴雨，我们还会早些到。（可能暗含if it had not been for the storm）。



## 9. 省去结果主句的非真实条件句

> **非真实条件句若省去结果主句，则常表示一种不可能实现的愿望。这种条件句常用if only来引导。如：**

If I could see him once我只要再见到他一次就好了。

If only he were here.

如果他在这儿就好了。

If only I hadn't done that.

我要是没做那事就好了

If only I had more time to think about it.

我要是有更多的时间考虑这个问题就好了。

If only you would take my advice.

你如果听我的意见就好了。

If only she didn't drive so fast!

她要是别开那么快就好了。



## 10. 不用if引导的条件句

> **非真实条件句的条件从句除用if引导外，还可用when, unless, lest, as if, for fear, in case, on condition that等词语来引导。如：**

The government prepared to award them when the experiment should be completed. 

政府已准备在实验完成后嘉奖他们。

> **但要注意：与if一样，上述词语所引导的条件从句也可用直陈语气，表可能实现或发生的事。**
